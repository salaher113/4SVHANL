# Release Notes - Joy TV v1.4.0

This release focuses on live TV playback stability and much broader playlist compatibility. It fixes the portrait-to-landscape handoff around Live TV playback, improves TV list interaction, and adds support for more real-world IPTV directives in both the app parser and the GitHub playlist generator.

## Live TV Playback
- Fixed the Live TV transition so the listing screen no longer rotates before the fullscreen player route takes over.
- Prevented the listing preview player from overlapping audio with the fullscreen channel player during route transitions.
- Improved fullscreen player lifecycle handling during channel switches and source reloads.

## Android TV Interaction
- Updated the landscape or Android TV channel list so fullscreen opens on double activation of the same list item instead of a single click.
- Kept preview behavior on first selection for better remote browsing.

## Playlist Parsing And Generation
- Added parser support for `#EXTVLCOPT`, `#KODIPROP`, `#EXT-X-APP`, `#EXT-X-APTV-TYPE`, and `#EXT-X-SUB-URL`.
- Preserved supported custom directives on parsed channels for future playback and metadata handling.
- Updated the playlist combiner to carry supported directives through into the generated combined playlist instead of dropping them.
- Added a workflow summary step to report key directive counts after playlist generation.

## Tooling And Docs
- Expanded parser test coverage for supported directives and comment-style lines.
- Refreshed the README to better describe the app, playlist support, and generation workflow.
